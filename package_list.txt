This folder contains a .venv directory, but for portability, you should use requirements.txt and install dependencies on the Raspberry Pi using pip.

Do NOT copy the .venv folder to the Pi. Only copy the following files and folders:

- main.py
- encrypt_password.py
- config.json
- requirements.txt
- README.txt
- Any CSV files you want to process (e.g., holdings_report.csv, holdings_cleaned.csv)

On the Pi, run:
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
